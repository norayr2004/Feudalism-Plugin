Feudalism-Plugin V.0.1
================


This is a plugin for a minecraft server that will enable users to establish their own kingdoms and inter-kingdom ranks


Here is the code for the plugin, mainly the Kingdom and Feudal aspects, however commands haven't been added yet
The config files contain all of the information for each kingdom as well as additional information about the kingdoms in general

A rule class will be added soon, which will function as a player currency but for political power
Essentially Rule will govern:
  -whether a player can create a kingdom based on their amount of rule
  -whether or not a player can overthrow a kingdom member or ruler
  -whether a player can claim another kingdom's land or not
